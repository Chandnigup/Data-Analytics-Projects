# About the Project
## Introduction
The crime dataset has been taken for visualization such that number of crimes can be observed using various factors. Supporting dataset of Arrest was also taken to provide deep insights using visualized graphs. The aim for creating different visualizations was to study the crime and arrest data using various useful attributes like time, date, crime type, longitude, latitude and area which helped in visualizing deeply on various factors. Through this visualization, variations in crime rate in Los Angeles can be seen and compared with arrest rate for the same time.
## Audience
The intended audience for this project was Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for whom it would be very beneficial to analyse statistics of crime and arrest easily by just few clicks in the following ways:
* It would help in analysing trends and patterns in crime which can be analysed using different factors.
* It would help the police department in the deploying resources in a more effective manner.
* It would assist detectives in identifying and apprehending suspects.
* It would develop profile for serial criminals.
* It would help in crime reduction and prevention.
* It would help in analysing increasing and decreasing trend in crime and arrest rate over the period.
